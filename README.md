# Flex-Exercise

Instruction

Find a website with some design patterns/layout and use Flexbox to recreate the layout.
Content and images are optional. I am mainly looking for the layout of the website.
It doesn't have to be exactly the same, you can pick and choose which part of the design you want to implement.
